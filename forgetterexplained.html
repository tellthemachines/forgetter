		<p>Forgetter is a JavaScript tool that takes a text input and ouputs the same text, minus a few of its words. Words can be either dropped, so they disappear completely, or erased, which means all their component letters are substituted by blank spaces.</p>
		<p>What to do with it: obtain several versions of the same text by running it a few times through the forgetter. These can be distributed to a group of people who may attempt to collectively reconstitute the original text, thus enacting the procedure of collective memory.</p>
		<p>Forgetter was made for a session of the <a href="https://baldioeng.wordpress.com/translationgroup/">Baldio Translation Group</a>, where I was given the word “forget” to work with. <a href="http://isabelbrison.com/baldiotranslation2">The research process is documented here</a>.</p>
